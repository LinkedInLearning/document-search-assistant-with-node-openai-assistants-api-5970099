## Course Description

Learn to build a smart document search assistant within a Node web application using OpenAI's Assistants API. In this course, instructor Guil Hernandez shows you how to get started setting up a development environment and configuring the AI assistant for integration into a Node project using Express. Discover how to implement advanced search capabilities using the File Search tool and vector stores, as well as use the API's Code Interpreter tool, handle user input, generate customized responses, and manage conversation threads. By the end of this course, you'll be equipped with a fully functional AI assistant capable of searching documents.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
